What do all these scripts do?  Here's some pseudocode.  Names in brackets are script names.

[nightly_test.pl]
  svn update
  make
  spawn [watchdog]
    currently very basic, will kill any benchmark that runs over an hour.
  for each benchmark,
    [compile_llvm]
      generate bitcode from .c code based on compile_info
    [test.py] single-threaded run
    [test.py] mtcg run
      [gen_profile.py]
        run opt to instrument code
        llc, gcc, and [run] the resulting bitcode
      run opt (here is the actual invocation of DSWP and MTCG)
      [link_llvm_smtx]
        run llvm-ld to generate native executable based on compile_info
      [run_bench.sh]
        runs benchmark according to exec_info_xxx
    check success
  kill watchdog
  generate text report
  [htmlize.pl]
    convert text report to prettier html version, diffing with previous text report to generate colors
